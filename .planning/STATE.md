# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Workers can reliably follow any SOP on their phone, step-by-step, with the right safety information always visible — even offline.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 2 of 4

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: —
- Total execution time: —

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: —
- Trend: —

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P00 | 3 | 2 tasks | 6 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Next.js 16 + Supabase + GPT-4o + Dexie.js + @serwist/next + TanStack Query (research-confirmed 2026-03-23)
- Multi-tenancy via Supabase RLS + JWT custom claims — must be in Phase 1 schema, not retrofittable
- Async parsing pipeline required — LLM parse takes 30-120s, HTTP timeouts at 30s
- Completion records are append-only (no UPDATE/DELETE) — legal defensibility requirement
- iOS Background Sync API unreliable — use online event + TanStack Query reconnect instead
- [Phase 01]: Playwright over Vitest for Phase 1: integration tests require real Supabase instance and browser, not unit mocks
- [Phase 01]: test.fixme for all stubs: tests are listed and skipped, producing a clear inventory without failing CI

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Job queue implementation choice unresolved (Supabase Edge Function triggered by Storage events vs. BullMQ on Vercel) — decide at start of Phase 2 planning
- Phase 3: iOS Safari evicts PWA storage after ~7 days inactivity — surface explicit per-SOP download UI with readiness indicator
- Phase 4: Push notification delivery on iOS requires PWA installed to home screen and iOS 16.4+ — in-app polling fallback may be required
