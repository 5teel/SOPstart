# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-23)

**Core value:** Workers can reliably follow any SOP on their phone, step-by-step, with the right safety information always visible — even offline.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — document-intake

## Current Position

Phase: 3

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Stack: Next.js 16 + Supabase + GPT-4o + Dexie.js + @serwist/next + TanStack Query (research-confirmed 2026-03-23)
- Multi-tenancy via Supabase RLS + JWT custom claims — must be in Phase 1 schema, not retrofittable
- Async parsing pipeline required — LLM parse takes 30-120s, HTTP timeouts at 30s
- Completion records are append-only (no UPDATE/DELETE) — legal defensibility requirement
- iOS Background Sync API unreliable — use online event + TanStack Query reconnect instead
- [Phase 01]: Playwright over Vitest for Phase 1: integration tests require real Supabase instance and browser, not unit mocks
- [Phase 01]: test.fixme for all stubs: tests are listed and skipped, producing a clear inventory without failing CI
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Next.js 16 uses proxy.ts (not middleware.ts) with proxy() export — middleware convention deprecated
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Windows requires explicit install of lightningcss-win32-x64-msvc and @tailwindcss/oxide-win32-x64-msvc for Tailwind v4 builds
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Supabase gen types: use 2>/dev/null redirect to prevent connection info polluting generated TypeScript file
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Server action redirect() throws in Next.js — catch blocks in form submit handlers must swallow all throws to allow redirect
- [Phase 01-foundation]: createServerClient from @supabase/ssr passes 3-generic SupabaseClient breaking Schema inference — fixed with explicit Promise<SupabaseClient<Database>> return type
- [Phase 01-foundation]: InviteAcceptForm requires Suspense boundary because useSearchParams() is async in Next.js App Router
- [Phase 01-foundation]: next build --webpack required: Next.js 16 Turbopack default conflicts with @serwist/next webpack plugin — build script updated
- [Phase 01-foundation]: SW disabled in development: disable: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' prevents aggressive caching during local dev
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: Added phase2-stubs Playwright project: new SOP test files not matched by existing integration/e2e project regex — required for test discovery
- [Phase 02-01]: Presigned URL upload: server action creates SOP record and signed URL atomically; client uploads directly to Storage bypassing Next.js 4MB body limit
- [Phase 02-01]: parse_jobs added to supabase_realtime publication at migration time to enable live status updates in admin UI
- [Phase 02-01]: Storage path structure: {org_id}/{sop_id}/original/{filename} enables org-scoped RLS without custom functions
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: [Phase 02-02]: openai SDK 6.x uses chat.completions.parse (not beta.chat) — beta namespace no longer contains chat in v6
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: [Phase 02-02]: tesseract.js ImageLike requires Buffer not Uint8Array — use Buffer.from(arrayBuffer)
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: [Phase 02-02]: PDF image extraction skipped for v1 — @napi-rs/canvas 50MB+ bundle risk on Vercel
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: Review page split into server component (page.tsx) + client component (ReviewClient.tsx): server fetches SOP/parse job/presigned URL, client manages approval state
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: Server-enforced publish gate: POST /publish counts unapproved sections server-side, returns 400 if any remain
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: Realtime + polling hybrid for parse status: subscribe to postgres_changes, start setInterval polling after 5s if no event fires
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: Parse triggered client-side: Next.js 16 aborts fire-and-forget fetch in server actions — call /api/sops/parse directly from client
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: mammoth requires Buffer.from() input: arrayBuffer option fails silently with 'Could not find file in options'
- [Phase 02-document-intake]: OpenAI structured outputs use .nullable() not .optional(): required by OpenAI structured output spec

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: Job queue implementation choice unresolved (Supabase Edge Function triggered by Storage events vs. BullMQ on Vercel) — decide at start of Phase 2 planning
- Phase 3: iOS Safari evicts PWA storage after ~7 days inactivity — surface explicit per-SOP download UI with readiness indicator
- Phase 4: Push notification delivery on iOS requires PWA installed to home screen and iOS 16.4+ — in-app polling fallback may be required
